1066742,20723614,10/4/2014,4405579,J.L.,Negative,A very unique experience with some unfortunate issues that could not get worked out. Thought we could have a fun non-hotel experience while on a business trip. Hot water was only available for 1 out of 4 days and this was very uncomfortable given that I was with clients all week. Ryan sent over a manager each day that was unable to fix the problem.
3917027,40354718,7/30/2015,33974852,Brandi,Positive,We had a late flight in and had to leave in the early am. When we arrived the key was waiting for us and our door was marked with our name. The house is on a quiet residential street and a very short walk to the train. This was our first Airbnb experience and we were not disappointed. 
11734812,65464730,3/13/2016,57331722,Saisha,Positive,"The apartment was really nice and comfortable. It was really sweet of the host to welcome us with a small goody basket. All essentials including shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, iron, utensils, etc. were available. we really enjoyed our stay! Thank you! "
1881298,60264029,1/21/2016,11868914,Jessica,Positive,"Excellent price for a private spot in Boston, and truly right on the T! Dan was nothing but helpful settling us in, as well. There is a TV with cable and (lucky for me, I needed it) a clothing iron and a hair dryer! I always appreciate when places consider these things for guests. There are some great little places an easy walk away - coffee shop, good Indian food, a liquor store. We knew the bed would be super soft from the reviews - you sink all the way into that memory foam! So, if you want a firm mattress, this ain't the place. But a nice spot overall - would stay again!"
3992208,94685296,8/16/2016,47998084,Laura,Negative,Nice neighbourhood. Great location. Very close to Fenway park. Unfortunately retrieving the key from a lock box locked to a fence over a highway was not a great first impression. Secondly the key to the apartment blocks did not work and we were stranded outside at night. I tried to contact Sean but there was no answer. We ended up ringing another apartment to let us in. It meant we could not leave the apartment to go explore boston because we wouldn't be able to get back in. If the key worked it would have been an ideal apartment to stay in. However knowing you can leave your apartment and get back in is kind of important. 
7264674,88432237,7/24/2016,6755681,Danielle,Positive,Krissy was a fabulous host and her place was in a perfect location. She was flexible and very helpful with any questions I had. Would stay again in the future. 
8830015,64466124,3/4/2016,22085074,Ian,Positive,Great apartment and host. Convenient location to the Amtrak train & bus station. Easy check in & check out. I'd definitely stay here again. 
3653207,87504567,7/20/2016,36236208,Tara,Positive,"Karen was great and very responsive when needed. There was plenty of parking on the street which is something I was nervous about. I would definitely stay at this apartment again 

Thank you!"
11593592,95655745,8/20/2016,77485459,Andrea,Positive,"The apartment is so, so, so super clean. Walking without shoes is no problem (very rare)!!! The airport and the rental car center is just around the corner. Lana was amazing and she even let us drop off our luggage before midday so we could explore the city without our suitcases. She also prepares a really wonderful homemade oatmeal with fresh fruits for her guests. I would give 100 from 100 points in all categories!!!"
4863108,69027369,4/8/2016,42759585,Ugwem,Positive,"Dan was incredibly considerate, thoughtful and helpful. I had a few issues with my flight and arrival time, and he was nothing but understanding. The place was clean, comfortable and the neighborhood seemed nice as well. One of my best airbnb experiences. "
4924910,42150070,8/11/2015,36459981,Margherita,Positive,"Very convenient location in the heart of the north end.
Anthony was very welcoming and helpful.
The apartment was roomy but maybe a little dirty."
66288,27397877,3/3/2015,3329997,Brittany,Negative,"I hate to leave a negative review, but after many Airbnb experiences, this one left a bit to be desired. The entrance key was not left behind for me; the previous guests hadn’t left it as they should have, but the host hadn’t ensured it was there, which wasn't the best way to welcome a guest if anything goes wrong. In the end, I waited an hour and a half outside the building, to the point that neighbors offered to let me in and asked if I was ok. I would have gone for a coffee or lunch to avoid loitering, but Sean told me he was coming shortly.  I had very little time to spend in Boston, and though Sean responded fairly quickly, he didn’t come for an hour. While Sean seemed like a nice, laid-back guy who tried to accommodate me and did apologize (a little), he seemed somewhat oblivious to the fact that this was kind of a big bummer and really threw my plans off.  When I realized there was no key, I asked Sean to call me so we could sort it all that way quickly, but he only texted and sent Airbnb messages, which wasn’t easy to handle in the cold on my phone , and I guess that made me feel like he was avoiding a conversation, which would have been reassuring. Upon entering the apartment late in the afternoon with him once he arrived (3pm, check in was about 1pm), I can’t lie; the place was pretty dirty, had an odor, and at that point I was a bit exasperated. To Sean’s credit, after I returned in the evening and he had changed the sheets and cleaned, it was better. (Sorry! As someone else mentioned, I think the place needs a deep clean and a bit of maintenance to be truly ready for guests--I understand the apartment is old and I don't care about that a bit, but that doesn't mean it can't be cleaned and maintained in a caring way, and I would feel a bit bad renting a place in this shape. It looks rougher than the pictures.) On the plus side: the apartment was the perfect temperature, it's conveniently located by the green line, the kitchenette is useful, wifi was fine, and Sean was really nice to bring a bike over for me that I felt badly I couldn't use in the end due to limited time and more snow. I get that things happen, and this is one way to do an Airbnb rental (minimal maintenance and a full guest list based on a good city location), but I would have appreciated a little more, “Sorry once again about the big hiccup getting in, I really apologize for that and will look into a better system so it doesn’t happen again!,” instead of him inquiring whether I’d returned the key (of course I did after my experience! :) )-- that would have gone a long way.

The Neighboorhood is not as bad as reviewed here. There are 4 other Airbnb rooms in the House. It was nice to meet other Travelers. With a very cheap Metroticket (18$ for 7 Days) you easily get to the Center in Boston within 15 minutes (5 minute walk to the Airport Metrostation). 

We had a nice stay at Izzys House. Thanks! "
1472520,52314345,10/28/2015,40651868,Harry,Positive,"A lovely stay with the Carneys.  The location is great for visiting Boston and the room is spacious and comfortable.  Excellent communication with the hosts, they make you really feel at home."
6324649,77287043,5/31/2016,18412408,Steven,Positive,"The apartment was as described and Jamie and Shelley were very friendly and accommodating. The place has a great style to it, very clean, a modern bathroom and shared kitchen. The bed was comfortable and even on a very hot day in Boston (~95*) the AC unit blew right over the bed and I slept comfortably. The apartment is in a great part of town, just two blocks from the subway Orange line. Parking is limited due to residential permits but I arrived on a Saturday afternoon and got lucky to find street parking 2.5 blocks away. The street parking is 2 hours on the weekdays but was free and unlimited on the weekend so it was perfect for our trip. Left the car there and took the subway/uber anywhere we needed to go."

Quinn-May a été très arrangeant pour les horaires.
La chambre est comme montré sur les photos, je recommande pleinement."
9362821,89146706,7/27/2016,72766231,Hyemin,Positive,I took a night bus and arrived at 7am in the morning. But the host welcomed me and allowed early check-in. The room was well-equipped and cozy. Everything including the bathroom was clean and the air-conditioner worked well. I think the best benefit of the host is location. I walked home around 11pm and the area was very safe. 
8428314,85819844,7/13/2016,73092547,Milena,Positive,"Doug was very accessible to ask questions about the process, this was our first experience with air bnb, it was very comfortable. The property was perfectly located for our needs. There are stores, restaurants and public transportation just a short walking distance from the front door.
The beds were very comfortable and we had a delightful experience.
Snacks and water was great.
Neighbors were nice and friendly thanks for a wonderful stay in Boston and a delightful experience!

The place was spotlessly clean.
Tobia's was very helpful and friendly
The location was close to public transportation and a local shopping area, as long as you did not mind a bit of walking"
